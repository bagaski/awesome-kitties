Awesome! Netlify CMS should now be available at localhost:3000/admin/index.html. Unfortunately we can't edit our content just yet. First we need to move our code into a git repository, and create a new Netlify site.

Tip: If you want to test changes made to your config.yml file locally, swap out "git-gateway"
